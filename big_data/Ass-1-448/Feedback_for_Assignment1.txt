Well done. 2b) Stats: This is a case of collinearity between the intercept and the explanatory variable. Both intercept and variable provide the same information, hence one of them is redundant. Geo: The vector of the intercept and the vector of X observations have identical directions, although with different length. Hence the area of the parallelogram defined by the two vectors is zero.
